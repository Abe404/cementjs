In Fig 01 illustrates the JavaScript files used in webAppA.
All the JavaScript files for this application reside in a folder called JavaScript.
Inside this are two folders. webAppA and widgetCo.
webAppA contains all the implementation specific code for the application.
The widgetCo folder includes some modules which are used (required) by webAppA.
The JavaScript modules in the widgetCo folder are re-usable modules developed by widgetCo.

## Fig: 01.
-----------
JavaScript -> webAppA ->  dashboard -> core.js
                          dashboard -> someWidget.js
           -> widgetCo -> datePicker -> datePicker.js
                       -> timeUtills.js

-----------


During development the unminified scripts must be included in the html page.
It is necessary to change the html embed code every time a script is added, renamed or removed.

Cement can be used to generate the embed code that can be inserted into a html page
Invoke cement with the embed command and a path to the scripts and cement will output
the embed code with the scripts in the correct order.

----------
$ cement embed root ./JavaScript  target ./JavaScript/webAppA/dashboard/core.js
Outputs:
<script type="text/javascript" src="/JavaScript/widgetCo/timeUtills.js"></script>
<script type="text/javascript" src="/JavaScript/widgetCo/datePicker/datePicker.js"></script>
<script type="text/javascript" src="/JavaScript/webAppA/someWidget.js"></script>
<script type="text/javascript" src="/JavaScript/webAppA/core.js"></script>
----------

A prepend option can be specified if the JavaScript folder does not reside at the web root

----------
$ cement embed prepend "/Content" ./JavaScript 
Outputs:
<script type="text/javascript" src="/Content/JavaScript/widgetCo/timeUtills.js"></script>
<script type="text/javascript" src="/Content/JavaScript/widgetCo/datePicker/datePicker.js"></script>
<script type="text/javascript" src="/Content/JavaScript/webAppA/someWidget.js"></script>
<script type="text/javascript" src="/Content/JavaScript/webAppA/core.js"></script>
----------

### Production ###
Embedding many JavaScript files can be detrimental to page load time.
It can be useful to combine all the files and then to minify them.
Cement can be used to combine the JavaScript files.
The combined files will contain the modules in the correct order as cement detects module dependencies.
Modules that are not in the core and are not required by any modules in the core will not be included in the compiled output.

To compile the JavaScript used in webAppA into a single file called combined.js

$ cement build root ./JavaScript path ./JavaScript/webappA/dashboard/core.js > ./JavaScript/webappA/dashboard/combined.js


<script type="text/javascript" src="/Content/JavaScript/webappA/dashboard/combined.js"></script>
