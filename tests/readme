cement.js uses nodeunit to run the tests
https://github.com/caolan/nodeunit


// There are too test suits
// one for cement.js and another for build.js
// buildtests.js tests that the build process works as it should
// and cementtests.js tests that the module require,
// define and events work as they should.
